# Expanding Cards (Udemy: 50 Projects In 50 Days - Day 1)

## 📝 Description

A small JavaScript application built by following Day 1 of the Udemy course  
“50 Projects In 50 Days - HTML, CSS & JavaScript”.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Practice DOM manipulation with vanilla JavaScript
- Understand event handling in the browser
- Implement UI behavior step by step using JavaScript

## 🚀 Features

- Interactive UI based on user actions
- Dynamic class toggling / style updates
- Responsive layout behavior (depending on the project)

## 🧩 Key Concepts Learned

- State management with the `active` class
- DOM selection (`querySelector`, `querySelectorAll`)
- Event listeners (`addEventListener`)
- NodeList manipulation (`panels.forEach()` for adding/removing classes)
- Class manipulation (`classList.add/remove/toggle`)
- Updating UI with CSS(flex + transition)

  > 💡 CSS handles the layout and animations, while **JavaScript only controls which element is active**

## 🛠 Tech Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (ES6+)
