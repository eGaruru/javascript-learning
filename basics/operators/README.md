# JavaScript Operators

## What I learned

- JavaScript provides operators,
  - arithmetic
  - assigment
  - comparison
  - logical
  - ternary

> 💡Operators are used to transform values, combine multiple values, or perform various operations on values.

## Arithmetic Operators

- `+ - * / %`
- Used for calculations
- `+` can use to combine string

## Assignment Operators

- `= += -= *=`
- Assign values to variables
- The result of the expression is stored in the variable

## Comparison Operators

- `=== !== > < >= <=`
- Always return boolean values, `true` or `false`
- Very useful when taking decisions based on conditions
- The result should be stored in a variable.

## Logical Operators

- `&& || !`
- Used in conditions

## Ternary Operator

- `condition ? value1 : value2`

> ⭐ console.log can display multiple values ​​at the same time
