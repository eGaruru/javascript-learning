# JavaScript Variables

## What I learned

- JavaScript provides three ways to declare variables: let, const, var

### `let` — use only when a value must change

- Can be reassigned
- Useful when declaring empty variables that receive a value later

### `const` — use by default

- Requires an initial value
- Cannot be reassigned
- ⚠ Object contents **can** be changed

### ⚠ `var` — should be avoided

- Old way of declaring variables (pre-ES6)
- Has function scope
- Can cause unexpected behavior
