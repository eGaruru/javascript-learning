## What I studied

- JavaScript variables (let, const, var)

## What I understood

- let can be reassigned, const cannot be reassigned
- use const as a default variable, sometimes use let when value must be changed
- ❗const require an initial value
- ❗const can aboid to reassign, but content of Object can be reassigned.
- var scope is confusing, should not be used

## What was difficult

## Next step

- JavaScript data types
