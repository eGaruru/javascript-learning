## What I studied

- JavaScript data types

## What I understood

- `Number`, `String`, `Boolean` are most used
- null and undefined are different
  - null: set by developer intentionally
  - undefined: set by JS automatically

- Symbol can create a unique and immutable value
  - Keys of objects that never conflict can be created.

- JavaScript has dynamic typing
  - **values have types**, NOT variables!!
  - JS determines automatically when value is assigned in a variable.

- typeof operator is useful to check data types

## What was difficult

- `typeof null` returns `"object"`

## Next step
